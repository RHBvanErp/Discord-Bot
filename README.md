# Discord-Bot
This is my Discord bot, it is a bot that can play music in your discord server.

To use the bot download all the files and go to this link (https://www.mediafire.com/file/xj951pvrybomqid/ffmpeg.zip/file) to download the FFMPEG file
run the setup.py and extract the FFMPEG zip file.
When you have done this go into Bot.py and enter your bot key and channel ID to the variables "key" and "channelID".
